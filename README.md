## papertool

This is a simple command line utility for performing efficient full-text
search in a large number of research paper PDFs. The tool extracts well-formed
sentences from all PDF files in a given directory and stores these in a text
file along with the source paper's metadata (that are pulled off the Internet
using publicly available services). I'm developing this mainly as a first
party productivity tool - atm it's missing the text mining components but am
aiming to have these included at some point.
